# Changelog

All notable changes to `learn`. Versions follow semantic versioning; each minor release was built
behind the `feat/learning-loop` branch and reviewed before merge.

## 2.0.0

A security release that also makes the package's own entry points work. It changes where learn
keeps state and how `resume` authorizes steps; "Moving from 1.6.0" below lists what to do.

### Security

Affected: 1.6.0 and earlier.

- **Path escape through `sessionId` and `runId`.** `learn_tutor_plan` joined `sessionId` into
  `tutor/<id>.json` with no check, so `"../.claude/settings"` replaced a project's
  `.claude/settings.json`. `learn_tutor_record`, `learn_verify` and `learn_receipt` read or
  rewrote files the same way, and `learn_dry_run`, `learn_tutor_prooflesson` and
  `learn_tutor_reverify` read any path, with a non-JSON file's first characters in the error.
  Ids now match `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}`, must not start with a dot or a hyphen and must not be a
  Windows device name. Every resolved path, after links and junctions, must stay inside the state
  folder. Path arguments resolve inside it, and a failure carries a closed code and fixed text. A
  path outside the folder on its text, such as a `\\host\share` UNC path, is refused before
  anything opens it, so no SMB or WebDAV connection is made. A link whose target does not exist
  is refused, not followed.
- **Resume submitted and paid without the opt-in.** `learn resume` passed
  `allowIrreversible: true` on every call. After a halt at `assess`, a plain resume clicked the
  next `submit` step and a `cost` step, and the receipt filed the submit as a witnessed automated
  submission. A resume now keeps the run's recorded mode, `--submit` takes only `manual` or
  `witnessed-auto`, and steps flagged `cost` or `irreversible` halt unless `--allow-cost` is given
  on the invocation that reaches them. The ledger entry of each step a grant allowed names it,
  and the receipt lists it (`witnessedAutoSubmissions[].authorizedBy`, `authorizedCostSteps`).
  The command line is read once, so a grant word given as the value of another flag, as in
  `--attest "--allow-cost"`, is that flag's value and grants nothing.
- **Children of `LEARN_*_CMD` inherited the caller's folder and environment.** With the documented
  `python -m crucible`, a `crucible/` package in the folder where `learn assist --crucible` ran was
  executed. Children now start through the vendored safe spawn helper 1.0.0
  (`src/_vendor/safe_spawn.mjs`, pinned in `VENDORED.sha256`): absolute executable, private empty
  folder, environment allowlist extended only by `LEARN_CHILD_ENV`,
  `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1` on Windows, `-P` and `PYTHONSAFEPATH=1` for Python.
  For the same reason `LEARN_NATIVE_CONTROL` must be an absolute path: a relative value imported a
  `browser.mjs` from the folder where `learn run --native` started.
- The shipped `docs/smoke.md` no longer names a local development folder. The code default was
  already removed on `main` and ships here for the first time.

### Breaking changes

- **State location.** Sessions (`tutor/`) and runs (`runs/`) live in `LEARN_HOME` when it is set,
  else in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\learn` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/learn` on macOS, and
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/learn` or `~/.local/share/learn` elsewhere. 1.6.0 wrote them into the folder the
  command started in. `learn status` prints the folder under `state`.
- **Resume.** A plain `learn resume` no longer submits or pays. `run --submit witnessed-auto` no
  longer covers `cost` steps. A completed or denied run cannot be resumed.
- **MCP errors.** A tool failure is a result with `isError: true` and `structuredContent`
  `{code, retryable, setup, detail}`, where code is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `NOT_FOUND`, `CONFLICT` or
  `INTERNAL`. 1.6.0 returned JSON-RPC `-32000` errors with free text. An unknown tool is `-32602`.
- **No silent overwrite.** `learn_tutor_plan` and `learn tutor plan` refuse to replace an existing
  session unless `replace: true` or `--replace` is given.
- **MCP paths.** `learn_dry_run` takes `workflow` inline or `workflowPath` inside the state
  folder; `packetPath` and `file` resolve inside it too. `learn_tutor_reverify` names each
  receipt relative to the state folder (`tutor/<id>.mastery.json`), not by its absolute path.
- **Peer commands.** A `LEARN_*_CMD` child sees only allowlisted variables and starts in a private
  folder, and a relative path in the command is refused. The interop functions `crucibleAssess`,
  `gatherRun` and `telosRender` are async; they are not package exports.

### Fixed

- The `learn` bin works. `src/cli.mjs` starts with `#!/usr/bin/env node`, the repository checks
  out LF everywhere (`.gitattributes`), and main-module detection compares real paths, so the bins
  npm links run. In 1.6.0 the bin printed nothing on Windows and failed on Linux.
- The human attestation records the real time of the resume. 1.6.0 recorded 1970-01-01.
- MCP `serverInfo.version` reports the package version; 1.6.0 said 1.0.0. A test now holds
  `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/index.mjs`, `serverInfo`, status, doctor, this file
  and the README to one version.

### Added

- `learn mcp` and a `learn-mcp` bin start the MCP server: `npx -y @harperz9/learn@2.0.0 mcp`.
- `--dir <folder>` on the CLI for a project-local state folder, and `LEARN_HOME` for every entry
  point. `learn status` and `learn_status` report the folder in use under `state`, with its
  source: `--dir`, `LEARN_HOME` or `default`. `LEARN_*_CMD` also takes a JSON argv array, which
  keeps a path with spaces whole.
- A release workflow. On a `v*` tag it checks the tag against every version site, smokes the packed
  tarball through `npx` on Windows, Linux and macOS, publishes with npm trusted publishing (npm
  records provenance), and creates a GitHub Release with the tarball and `SHA256SUMS`. CI runs the
  same tarball smoke on every push. Actions are pinned by commit SHA.
- Also released from `main` for the first time: the repository art and its tests, and the
  `src/interop.mjs` organ-bundle entries (not exported and not imported by the package).

### Moving from 1.6.0

- To keep sessions and runs in a project folder, pass `--dir <that folder>` or set `LEARN_HOME` to
  it. To move them, copy the folder's `tutor/` and `runs/` into the folder `learn status` prints.
- A run that should submit on resume: pass `--submit witnessed-auto` on `run` or on that resume. A
  run that should pay: pass `--allow-cost` on the invocation that reaches the payment step.
- MCP clients that read JSON-RPC error text read `structuredContent.code` instead.
- `LEARN_TELOS_CMD="node ../telos/src/cli.mjs"` becomes
  `LEARN_TELOS_CMD='["node", "/absolute/path/to/telos/src/cli.mjs"]'`. Name any variable a peer CLI
  needs in `LEARN_CHILD_ENV`, for example `LEARN_CHILD_ENV=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## 1.6.0

The derive-schedule entry below shipped in the published 1.6.0 package. Earlier copies of this
file listed it under Unreleased.

- `tutor/fsrsderive.mjs`: make the FSRS schedule a **re-derivable function of the witnessed graded
  attempt log**. `deriveItemStates(attempts)` replays the recorded scored attempts (each carries its
  `grade` + `timestamp`) through the same pure `gradeAttempt()` math the live scheduler uses, so it
  reconstructs `session.itemState` bit-for-bit from `session.attempts` alone (proven by a parity test
  against the live state). `deriveScheduleReceipt(session)` audits the cached hint against that clean
  replay and emits a `MATCH` / `DRIFT` / `NO_FSRS_LOG` verdict plus a hash-chained ledger over the
  graded attempts; the log-derived state is authoritative, so a stale or tampered cache is flagged as
  `DRIFT` with a per-field diff rather than trusted. `optimizeParameters(attempts)` adds an *advisory*
  per-learner fit: one initial-difficulty prior per objective, fitted from that learner's own accuracy
  (a documented heuristic prior, not a full FSRS weight optimization); it never moves the audit
  verdict or the mastery gate. Wired into the CLI (`tutor derive-schedule <id> [--optimize]`, writes
  `tutor/<id>.derive-schedule.json`, non-zero exit on DRIFT) and MCP (`learn_tutor_derive_schedule`,
  `optimize`). A new `doctor` invariant `tutor.schedule_rederivable_from_log` proves the audit can
  FAIL: a clean session re-derives to MATCH and a tampered cache is caught as DRIFT. INTEGRITY
  unchanged: `fsrsderive.mjs` is pure, never calls `Date.now()`, never grades, never appends to
  `session.attempts`, and never feeds the mastery gate: `itemState` stays a hint, the witnessed log
  stays the truth. Backward compatible: all prior tests pass; 14 new tests across
  `learn-fsrs-derive.test.mjs` (10) and `learn-fsrs-derive-cli.test.mjs` (4).

- `tutor/fsrs.mjs` + `tutor/itemscheduler.mjs`: opt-in FSRS-class adaptive memory model.
  Per-item *difficulty* / *stability* / *retrievability* with a user-set retention target, so the
  scheduler decays each item on its own forgetting curve and next-selects the item you are most
  likely to have forgotten (retrievability-ranked), rather than re-surfacing whole objectives on a
  fixed Leitner ladder. `fsrs.mjs` is pure math (no I/O, no `Date.now()` — `now` is always
  injected); `itemscheduler.mjs` owns the derived `session.itemState` and self-heals corrupt or
  missing state on BOTH the ranking/read path (`sortByRetrievability`/`selectNextItem`) and the
  grading/write path (`recordAttemptWithGrade` heals before grading), so a nonsensical interval can
  never reach a learner and a corrupt stored stability can never contaminate the grade math. Enabled per session:
  `newSessionWithFSRS` / `tutor.recordAttemptWithGrade` (grades 0-4), and threaded behind a
  default-false `useFSRS` flag through `schedule.reviewState`/`due` and `study.studyPlan`/
  `studyReceipt`. Wired into the CLI (`plan --enable-fsrs`, `record --grade/--now`, `study` /
  `study-receipt` / `due --use-fsrs/--desired-retention`) and MCP (`enableFsrs`, `grade`, `now`,
  `useFsrs`, `desiredRetention`). INTEGRITY: the mastery-gate still reads `session.attempts` only —
  `itemState` is a scheduling hint, never a verdict — proven by `learn-fsrs-isolation.test.mjs`
  (corrupt/delete itemState, mastery and study-receipt unchanged). Fully backward compatible: all
  prior tests pass unchanged, `useFSRS` defaults false, and the flags fall back to the Leitner/
  interleave path on legacy sessions with no `itemState`.
- `tutor/prooflesson.mjs` + `tutor/prooflessonverify.mjs`: proof-packet -> lesson. `proofLesson`
  consumes a proof-surface-style packet JSON (`version`, `packet_id`, `claim`, `scope`,
  `sources[{ref,sha256}]`, `verdicts.overall`; unknown wedge-specific blocks are treated as
  opaque) and derives a lesson that preserves the packet's own evidence surface: source refs
  (never bodies), the claim, the packet's verdict, an explanation scaffold (numbered prompts for
  the learner to derive the reasoning; the packet's decision reasoning is never dumped),
  retrieval-practice questions derived from the packet's own fields (including "what evidence
  would falsify this claim"), and a verifier binding (verdict + packet_id + source hashes). The
  lesson verdict is copied from the packet and from nowhere else; the derived lesson is frozen,
  so a lesson claiming MATCH from a DRIFT packet is impossible by construction, and a forged
  verdict enum is rejected up front.
- `misconceptionFromPacket`: for DRIFT / UNVERIFIABLE packets, a typed misconception record
  (`packet_id`, `verdict`, `misconception_class`: `contradicted` for DRIFT, `overclaim` for
  UNVERIFIABLE with recorded sources, `missing_evidence` for UNVERIFIABLE without) whose prompt
  asks the learner WHY the proof attempt failed; a MATCH packet yields none.
- `proofLessonReceipt`: the lesson receipt hash-chains a packet binding, one entry per source
  ref+hash, and the canonical lesson digest through the existing ledger machinery, and
  `learn tutor reverify` covers it: a tampered entry is `CHAIN_BROKEN`, a flipped verdict or
  edited lesson body is `VERDICT_MISMATCH`, and a chainless or illegal-enum receipt is
  `UNVERIFIED`, never verified.
- CLI: `learn tutor prooflesson <id> --packet <packet.json>` writes
  `tutor/<id>.prooflesson.json` and exits 1 on a rejected packet, writing nothing.
- MCP: `learn_tutor_prooflesson` (advisory, read-only; derives the lesson + misconception from an
  inline packet or a packet file, writes nothing).
- `doctor` gains `tutor.prooflesson_rejects_known_bad`: a clean packet must derive and re-verify,
  and each known-bad input must be rejected (forged verdict enum, tampered chain entry, verdict
  flipped MATCH-from-DRIFT, chainless receipt).
- `tutor/reverify.mjs`: tutor-receipt re-verification with typed failure codes. `reverifyReceipt`
  recomputes a receipt's own evidence instead of trusting its stored booleans (`verified` /
  `ledgerVerified` are author-controlled and deliberately ignored): the hash chain over the
  witnessed practice entries must recompute (a break is typed `CHAIN_BROKEN` with the offending
  entry's seq and hash; a hash-consistent truncation is caught by attempt accounting) and the
  stored mastery verdict must re-derive from the recorded attempts under the recorded policy (a
  divergence is typed `VERDICT_MISMATCH` with both projections). A chainless receipt re-verifies
  as `UNVERIFIED`, never as verified. A clean re-check carries a witnessed summary digest.
- CLI: `learn tutor reverify <id> [--file <receipt.json>]` exits 0 only when every checked receipt
  re-verifies as VERIFIED; any typed failure or UNVERIFIED receipt exits 1.
- MCP: `learn_tutor_reverify` (advisory, read-only).
- `doctor` gains `tutor.reverify_rejects_known_bad`: the re-verifier must pass a clean receipt and
  reject each known-bad fixture (tampered chain entry, hand-edited verdict, chainless receipt).
  A verifier that cannot fail on a known-bad input is not a verifier.

## 1.5.0

The learning loop reaches its first complete shape: every planned teach-you capability is shipped
behind the mastery-gate, and the pieces compose into one orchestrator instead of standing alone.

- `tutor/study.mjs`: the study orchestrator. Composes `due` (spaced repetition), `misconceptions`
  (ranked aggregation), an interleaved practice order, prerequisite readiness (from the concept
  map), and the mastery-gate verdict into one `studyPlan`; `studyReceipt` wraps the same plan in a
  witnessed, hash-chained receipt.
- CLI: `learn tutor study <id> --now <iso>` and `learn tutor study-receipt <id> --now <iso>`.
- MCP: `learn_tutor_studyplan` and `learn_tutor_misconceptions` (advisory, read-only).
- `doctor` gains a check that a study-receipt composition never lets a render, a visualization, or
  a pending prediction move the mastery needle.

## 1.4.0

- `tutor/predict.mjs`: predict-then-observe. `recordPrediction` records the operator's own
  prediction as a pending attempt (`correct: null`) before any observation; `scorePrediction`
  grades it afterward against what the operator actually saw. A pending prediction is never
  silently read as correct by `mastery()`.
- `tutor/map.mjs`: concept map. Normalizes objectives given as plain strings or as
  `{id, text, requires}`, computes a topological `learningPath`, and gates each objective's
  readiness on its prerequisites' mastery.
- CLI: `learn tutor predict`, `learn tutor score`, `learn tutor path`.
- `interop/telos.mjs`: the visualization bridge (`toTelosSceneSpec`, `telosRender`,
  `toAidLedgerEntry`). Concepts render as witnessed AID visualizations through the telos engine
  over `LEARN_TELOS_CMD`, fail-closed when the engine is not configured, and are recorded in the
  study log as mastery-independent (`recordVisualization`).
- CLI: `learn visualize <concept.json>`. MCP: `learn_visualize_dry_run` (advisory; renders
  nothing, returns only the scene-spec request).
- Receipt: adds an `aidVisualizations` section, structurally separate from
  `humanAssessments` / `manualSubmissions` / `witnessedAutoSubmissions`.
- `doctor` gains `telos.render_fail_closed`, `receipt.aid_never_graded`, and
  `tutor.mastery_render_visualization_independent` checks.
- fix: corrected the README test count (37 -> 67 at the time) and hardened the
  `aid_never_graded` doctor check against a receipt that silently promoted an aid render.
- chore: scoped the npm package name to `@harperz9/learn` (the bare name was taken); gitignored
  the SDD scratch directory before publishing.

## 1.3.0

The tutor layer: the teach-you engine and its mastery-gate, plus the first two learning-loop
capabilities.

- `tutor/tutor.mjs`: `newSession`, `recordAttempt`, `mastery`, `masteryReceipt`. A session tracks
  objectives and practice attempts; `mastery()` reports per-objective and overall readiness from
  accuracy and attempt-count thresholds, computed only from recorded attempts.
- `tutor/schedule.mjs`: spaced repetition (SM-2-lite / Leitner ladder) over the practice log;
  `due()` reports objectives due for review, most-overdue first.
- `tutor/misconception.mjs`: aggregates wrong attempts and the operator's own feedback per
  objective, ranked by count.
- `tutor/retrieval.mjs`: `clozePrompts` turns the operator's own assist-extracted claims into
  blanked recall prompts carrying a source; `interleave` gives a deterministic (seeded, no
  `Math.random`) mixed study order.
- `tutor/explain.mjs`: self-explanation grading. Wraps the operator's own explanation into a
  crucible thesis and buckets its claims' verdicts into grounded / shaky / unverifiable.
- CLI: `learn tutor <plan|record|mastery|receipt|due|misconceptions|retrieval|explain>`.
- MCP: `learn_tutor_plan`, `learn_tutor_record`, `learn_tutor_mastery`, `learn_tutor_due` added to
  the advisory tool set.
- `doctor` gains `gate.assess_never_allow` extended coverage and the mastery-gate falsifiable
  tests: a session with a mastered practice log stays ready regardless of what else is attached to
  it, and a session below threshold is never reported ready.

## 1.0.0

Flagship parity: the credential-logistics engine reaches its first complete, tested shape.

- `accountability/`: `witness` (content-addressed hashing), `ledger` (hash-chained, tamper-evident
  append log), `gate` (default-deny step admission; `assess` always resolves to `needs-human`).
- `workflow/`: declarative step schema, load + seal.
- `runtime/runner.mjs`: gate -> actuate -> witness -> verify -> ledger, with halt/resume.
- `actuation/`: `FakeDriver` (offline/deterministic) and `NativeDriver` (real browser via
  native-control), selected by `--native` on the CLI.
- `adapters/`: `fake`, `generic` (config-driven), and an LMS pack: Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn
  Learning, edX, Credly, then Microsoft Learn, NonprofitReady, and a generic self-paced adapter.
- `receipt/`: dual-plus format (JSON + Markdown + HTML) separating automated logistics from human
  assessment.
- `assist/`: turns the operator's own draft into a crucible thesis (claims -> verdicts) and a
  gather manifest (sources -> receipts); authors nothing.
- Submission modes: `manual` (engine halts at each submit) and `witnessed-auto` (engine performs
  the submit via actuation with operator authorization, recording a witnessed before/after
  digest); submission mode never touches `assess` steps.
- `doctor.mjs` / `status.mjs`: the operator-spine self-check (MATCH/DEGRADED, one falsifiable
  check per integrity invariant) and capability envelope.
- `mcp.mjs`: zero-dependency JSON-RPC/stdio MCP server exposing the advisory tool set
  (`learn_doctor`, `learn_status`, `learn_verify`, `learn_receipt`, `learn_dry_run`); actuation
  stays on the operator-driven CLI.
- CLI: `learn <run|resume|verify|receipt|doctor|status|assist>`.
