// FSRS ISOLATION — the load-bearing negative test.
//
// The integrity rule: "scheduling is a hint, grading is audited fact." session.itemState (the FSRS
// scheduling state) must NEVER influence the mastery verdict, which is derived from session.attempts
// alone. If a future change accidentally couples scheduling to grading, THIS test must fail loudly.
//
// It also proves the enforced boundary: a corrupt item state cannot ship a nonsensical interval to a
// learner, and recording a graded attempt for an item that has no state yet auto-initializes it
// rather than silently creating an ungraded scheduling hole.
