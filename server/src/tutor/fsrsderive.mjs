// Re-derive the FSRS schedule PURELY from the witnessed graded attempt log, and fit a small
// per-learner parameter from that same log. This is the accountability spine applied to scheduling:
// session.itemState is only a cached HINT, and this module proves that hint is exactly what replaying
// session.attempts (the tamper-evident, hash-chained truth) produces, or reports the DRIFT.
//
// INTEGRITY (the load-bearing boundary this module defends):
//   - session.attempts is the GRADED, witnessed source of truth. Each FSRS-graded attempt carries a
//     `grade` (0-4) and an ISO `timestamp` (written by tutor.recordAttemptWithGrade). That is exactly
//     the information gradeAttempt() needs, so the ENTIRE itemState is a deterministic function of the
//     recorded attempts. Nothing here reads Date.now(); replay is anchored to each attempt's own
//     recorded timestamp, so a derivation is bit-for-bit reproducible.
//   - This module NEVER grades, never appends to session.attempts, and never feeds the mastery gate.
//     It only reconstructs / audits the scheduling hint. If itemState and the replay disagree, the
//     replay is authoritative (it comes from the witnessed log); the receipt reports DRIFT so a
//     tampered or stale cached hint is caught rather than trusted.
//
// The per-learner fit is deliberately honest and lightweight: it estimates a single initial-difficulty
// prior per objective from THAT learner's own accuracy on the objective (via difficultyFromAccuracy),
// not a full gradient-descent FSRS optimizer. It is a documented heuristic, not a claim of optimality.
